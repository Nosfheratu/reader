    %h4{id: "mandatory_gplus"} Why is the login asking to create a Google Plus account i.e. enter name, gender, age, etc?
    %h4.thin Google mandatorily asks to create Google Plus account if external developers like us use Google Login. So that is not us. :-) To mitigate this, we are adding Facebook login soon.
